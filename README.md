## Purpose of this analysis:
- To predict the accuracy of healthy loans
- and to predict the accuracy of high-risk loans

## Report 
- The accuracy score of the model was 0.9918489475856377 which is very high and shows how accurate it is.
- The healthy loan is virtually 100% accurate since its precision is 1.00 while the high-risk loan is pretty accurate considering it has a precision score of 0.85. The model can more accurately predict healthy loans in comparison with high-risk loans
- There was quite a bit of improvement on the high-risk loan which was 0.85 as it precision increased up to 0.99 which was a 14% increase in accuracy due to oversampling. 
- The recall score for healthy loans was 0.99 which proves that the model is great at identifying positive examples and this is also the case for high-risk loans even though it had a lower of recall score of 0.91.

## Conclusion
- I recommend that the machine learning model is used by the company due to the fact that it not only has a really high accuracy score of 0.99 but also because both healthy loans and high-risk loans have high precision scores especially heaalthy loans (100% accuracy). In addition, I'm also recommending the model because both of the recall scores for the healthy loans and high-risk loans are high showing how good the model is at identifying both positive examples.
